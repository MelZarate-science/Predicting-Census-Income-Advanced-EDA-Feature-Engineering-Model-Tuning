# Predicting-Census-Income-Advanced-EDA-Feature-Engineering-Model-Tuning
Predicting income levels using a professional ML Pipeline. I evaluated multiple models (Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost) using GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters. Features automated preprocessing with ColumnTransformer, SMOTE for class imbalance, and robust scaling.
